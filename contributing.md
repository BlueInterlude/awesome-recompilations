# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- The entry should contain the name of the recompilation, the creator, a GitHub link (if no GitHub repository exists, you may link to a website with a preview of the recompilation), and a brief description. The brief description should cover the name of the game and any notable features. 
    - Notable features may include mods or texture packs. If referencing a mod or texture pack, include a link, the creator, and a brief description of the mod. Only list at most five notable features. 
        - For example: 
            - The Zelda 64 Recompilation features a "Modern Controller Overhaul" mod allowing users to configure the HUD to match whichever controller they are using. To download the mod, see https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/tomtee/Modern_Controller_Overhaul/.

    - Include if the project is currently active. If the project has not received updates in a year or longer, the project is not active. Write `Active` or `Inactive` in brackets at the end of the entry.
