# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

## Content Guidelines

- The entry should contain the name of the recompilation, the creator, a GitHub link (if no GitHub repository exists, you may link to a website with a preview of the recompilation), and a body. The body should contain a brief description with details on the project's development and any notable features. 
    - Title Field:
        - Write the name of the game.
    - Body Section:
        1. Emojis:
            - At the beginning of a game's description, include an emoji indicating if the project is released, and an emoji indicating if the project is currently active. If the project is released, use `:unlock:`, if the project is not released, use `:lock:`. If the project is currently active, use `:bell:`, if the project is currently inactive, use `:no_bell:`
        2. Below the emoji, include the following blurb about the recompilation:
            - [link](link) _by [Developer Name](link)_ [Is the project released?] [Project Status]
                - Project Status: 
                    - Include if the project is released and can be downloaded. If the project has a public release, write [Released] in brackets at the end of the entry. If the project is still a work in progress and cannot be downloaded, write [`Unreleased`].
                    - Include if the project is currently active. If the project has not received updates in a year or longer, the project is not active. Write `Active` or `Inactive` in brackets at the end of the entry. If the project has not been released, write `Unknown.
                - Credits:
                    - If you are not sure who the developer is (in the case the project is unreleased), write `Unknown`.
                    - If the project is under an organization, you may write the organization name instead of a singular developer.
                    - If the project does not currently have a GitHub repository, link to the user's socials if those socials are currently being used to talk about the project.
- This project is strictly for recompilation projects using N64Recomp and XenonRecomp. Any pull requests adding projects not using these tools will not be accepted.
