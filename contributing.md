# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- The entry should contain the name of the recompilation, the creator, a GitHub link (if no GitHub repository exists, you may link to a website with a preview of the recompilation), and a brief description. The brief description should cover the name of the game and any notable features. 
    - Notable features may include mods or texture packs. If referencing a mod or texture pack, include a link, the creator, and a brief description of the mod. Only list at most five notable features. 
        - For example: 
            - The Zelda 64 Recompilation features a "Modern Controller Overhaul" mod allowing users to configure the HUD to match whichever controller they are using. To download the mod, see https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/tomtee/Modern_Controller_Overhaul/. 
    - Title Field:
        - Include the name of the game, the year it originally released in, an emoji indicating if the project is released, and an emoji indicating if the project is currently active. If the project is released, use `:unlock:`, if the project is not released, use `:lock:`. If the project is currently active, use `:bell:`, if the project is currently inactive, use `:no_bell:`
    - Project Status: 
        - nclude if the project is released and can be downloaded. If the project has a public release, write [Released] in brackets at the end of the entry. If the project is still a work in progress and cannot be downloaded, write [`Unreleased`].
        - Include if the project is currently active. If the project has not received updates in a year or longer, the project is not active. Write `Active` or `Inactive` in brackets at the end of the entry. If the project has not been released, write `Unknown.
    - Credits:
        - If you are not sure who the developer is (in the case the project is unreleased), write `Unknown`.
        - If the project is under an organization, you may write the organization name instead of a singular developer.
        - If the project does not currently have a GitHub repository, link to the user's socials if those socials are currently being used to talk about the project.
    - If possible, include pictures or videos of the game running.
